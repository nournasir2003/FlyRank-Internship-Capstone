# FlyRank Internship Capstone

This project is a Next.js front-end application built for the FlyRank Front-end AI Engineer Intern track. It serves as a practical capstone foundation for building modern React applications with AI-assisted workflows, clean architecture, and professional development habits.

## Project Overview

The app currently includes a small multi-page experience with:

- a main landing page
- a settings page with a validated account settings form
- a health check route that fetches live data from an external advice API

This structure reflects the early stages of a larger capstone product and provides a solid base for future expansion.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 16
- React 19
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwind CSS
- ESLint

## Features

- App Router-based page structure
- Responsive navigation between pages
- Client-side form validation for account settings
- Save confirmation state for the settings form
- Health check page that demonstrates server-side data fetching

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm (included with Node.js)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

- Use Client Components only when browser interactivity is required.
- Keep reusable UI logic in the components folder.
- Run linting and production builds before committing major changes.
